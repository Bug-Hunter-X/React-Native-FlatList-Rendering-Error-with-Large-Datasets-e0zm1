# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using FlatList in React Native with large datasets or asynchronous data fetching.  The problem involves the FlatList component not rendering correctly, potentially leading to blank screens, incorrect data display, or silent failures. 

## Problem Description

The `bug.js` file contains a React Native component that fetches data from an API and displays it using a FlatList. When dealing with a large number of items or slow network responses, the FlatList may fail to render the data accurately, causing a blank screen or displaying an incomplete list.  Error handling may also be insufficient, making debugging difficult.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that addresses these issues. It incorporates improved error handling, better data management, and potentially optimization techniques to handle large datasets efficiently.  Techniques used include pagination or virtualization to render only the necessary data.  The solution also incorporates more robust error messages for easier debugging.
